Welcome to grade 12 Computer Science with Mr. Schattman period C I'm looking forward to seeing the upper halves of your smiling faces on Thursday at 11:40 am in room 1706 Bring a Chromebook and a positive attitude Or bring an attitude and a positive Chromebook Whichever suits you that morning
If we have a snow day we will meet by Google Meet
To confirm that you saw this message leave a joke in the comments below I'll start
Our lessons and HW for today Those of you learning from home take yourself through the slideshow then try the HW Email me questions
Tell us what you were curious about since last Friday
Our lesson for Monday
Video version of our lesson on introduction to Processing in case you need a review or missed it live
Your HW tonight Go to the Processing reference page and learn 3 more features of Processing besides what we showed in the lesson
To run Processing from a Chromebook
Login to the Windows Virtual Desktop using your normal school login
Within the WVD click the Windows logo in the lower left corner of the screen and select Processing from the list
Below is a link to a .zip file that contains all the example Processing programs that I will show in the course
Please copy the .zip file to your Windows Virtual Desktop and extract it to a folder
Here's how
Copy this link to your clipboard
Login to the WVD by clicking here
Within the WVD open Google Chrome
In Chrome paste the link into the browser and push Enter
Click the Download arrow upper right part of the screen
The WVD will prompt you for where on the WVD you want to save the .zip file Pick Desktop
The file ICS4UI.zip should now appear your WVD
Right-click the .zip file and select Extract all
The folder ICS4UI should now be on your desktop Double click it to get to any Processing program that I direct you to in the future
Teach yourself how to do for-loops in Processing Java C
Instructions for Friday
Today please spend
10 minutes reading this short amazing lesson on 2D arrays
65 minutes on your First Coding Assignment
20 minutes going outside and building a snowhuman
Our lesson for Tuesday
Your HW Make a simple text file and write a Processing program that reads in that text file and does something useful with it
HW for Wednesday Read this lesson on how to write Processing functions that return arrays and take arrays as parameters
Lesson for Thursday
Read the lesson try the exercises and watch the video on Foxes and Rabbits
Run the Processing program described in the lesson and try various scenarios
Read the program from top to bottom and answer the questions on it given at the end of the lesson
Lesson for Friday
Next week we will be starting our modeling assignment
You'll be choosing a phenomenon from nature to model and writing a Processing program that animates a simulation of that phenomenon
The type of model we'll be using is called a cellular automaton A cellular automaton is a model that uses a 2D grid of coloured squares to illustrate some process e.g. a forest fire like the demo we saw on the first day of class the spread of pollution in the ocean the flow of customers in a store the movement of red blood cells in an artery chemical reactions etc.
To get inspired for picking your own project please run all of the student Processing programs in the folder
Should take about 30 to 40 minutes Watch all of them but pick 1 or 2 of them to read in detail to get a sense of how they work Your HW for the weekend is to brainstorm about which natural phenomenon you would like to model Come to school on Monday with 3 good ideas
Planning to code
Project description for the Cellular Automaton Assignment We'll set a due date soon For now just familiarize yourself with the requirements
Intro to our next marked assignment
No need to start coding now
Just start dreaming about what you'd like to do for yours
We'll start in earnest on Monday
Read this mini essay on the philosophy of complex numbers
Play with this program for a while
Read the final lesson for the last few technical details then start coding
Introductory lesson on object oriented programming
Try coding this in Processing and ask me any questions you have
Play with this program to download it copy this link open WVD within WVD open Chrome paste the link into Chrome Download the .zip file to your WVD
Play with this traffic simulator developed by a team of three students in 2019 as their SE Team Design Project for 10 minutes Next read the design document that the team wrote before they began writing the code Finally read the user manual they wrote for their future customers Finally finally be inspired this is the kind of project you and two random teammates will create in the coming weeks
Schedule and marking for the SE Team Design Project
Nominations for our valedictorian
Instructions for Wednesday
Work on your team project for 30 minutes sometime today Rehearse what you will say during your team's prototype demo Be thankful you are not a teacher because we all had to come to school today at 8:30
Someone left their phone in 1706 on Monday or Tuesday It is crying out for its mother Please claim if yours
Instructions for Monday
Today is Day 8 of your 10 day team project Spend today testing and debugging Rough outline of your day Finish your last feature Code freeze here No more new features from here on out Each person runs your program intentionally trying to make it crash generate errors or give a wrong output Without trying to fix the bugs write them down and assign a person on the team to fix each bug
Invite one or two people from other teams to try out your program tell them to try to break the program and generate errors ask them to tell you what they found take their advice like a good sport and don't be offended
Vote for this year's valedictorian from our short list of 6 candidates
Bubble sort
Read the lesson especially the last section on pseudocode
Code bubble sort in processing for HW tonight
Discovering better sorting algorithms
Review the lesson
Try coding insertion sort in Processing
Our outline for this unit Note the days of the unit test next Wednesday

Final project description
Marking for the final project has been revised from the original Note how the milestones on the timeline will be marked
By popular request ie 2 people here are the bachata and salsa playlists I played for the cool 6 people who were present in class the day after prom
Pick one person from your team to turn in the project on your team's behalf. Please post a comment with your submission listing your 3 team members so I know whose program is whose.
Submit as a .zip file or as a github link.
Up to 5 marks will be ?deducted for late submissions. The reason is that delivering things on a schedule is one of the learning objectives of the project.
Take your team out for lunch this week to celebrate!
